== Welcome to the Editable Image Sample Application

This is a simple image gallery application to demonstrate how to use the
editable-image library (http://github.com/haikuwebdev/editable-image/) from 
within a Rails application.

To install this on your local machine, you need to do the following:

1. Check out this sample application:
   git clone git://github.com/haikuwebdev/editable_image_sample.git

2. Initialize and update the rails and plugin submodules this application
   depends on:
   git submodule init
   git submodule update

3. Create your database and edit the database.yml file. Don't forget to
   run 'rake db:migrate' to populate the database.

4. Resister for a free account at Picnik.com http://www.picnik.com/info/api
   When you get your API key, edit the picnik_params hash at the bottom of
   app/controllers/attfu_images_controller.rb. You will also want to insert 
   your domain name where you see YOUR_URL_HERE. You will need this url to be 
   publically accessible so that Picnik can send the edited pictures back to 
   your site.

5. Start your Rails server and take the sample app for a spin!
